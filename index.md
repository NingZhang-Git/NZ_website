## **About Me**
I am a research based master student in the department of ECE at the University of British Columbia and my advisor is Lele Wang. I am very fortunate to work with [Lele Wang](https://ece.ubc.ca/lele-wang/) and [Weina Wang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weinaw/) on my thesis project about graph alignment. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Physics from school of Poling (an academic talent program) at Nankai University in 2019. I was fortunate to have [Xin Chen](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszxc/) to advise me on my undergraduate thesis.\

## **Research**
In a general sense, I am interested in the mathematical foundations of data science and computational problems, which may involve theories about probability, combinatorics, algorithms, statistics, optimization, etc. For computational tasks, I am particularly interested in providing provable performance guarantees that go beyond the worst-case scenario. I am excited to see the transformation of ideas across different research fields, and I am very motivated to prove things built on interesting intuitions or compelling application motivations. 
Currently, I'm working on the random graph alignment problem. For such a problem, I mainly focus on characterizing the information-theoretical limits and designing efficient algorithms with a high probability of success.
