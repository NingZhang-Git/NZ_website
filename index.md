## **About Me**
I am a research based master student in the department of ECE at the University of British Columbia and my advisor is Lele Wang. I am very fortunate to work with [Lele Wang](https://ece.ubc.ca/lele-wang/) and [Weina Wang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weinaw/) on my thesis project about graph alignment. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Physics from school of Poling (an academic talent program) at Nankai University in 2019. I was fortunate to have [Xin Chen](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszxc/) to advise me on my undergraduate thesis.\

## **Research**
My current research interest is mainly about graph theory, probability theory and algorithms. More specifically, I'm studying graph alignment problems. For such a problem, I mainly focus on investigating the information-theoretical limits and designing efficient algorithms, which will succeed with high probability for graphs generated from some particular random graph models.

Beyond what I am working on, I am interested in spectral methods and statistical learning theory. I also know fundamental physics and some basics of machine learning. I am excited to see the transformation of ideas and methods among very different research fields, and I am very motivated to prove things built on some interesting intuitions/images.
