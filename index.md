## **About Me**
I am a DPhil in the statistics department at the University of Oxford (Computational Discovery CDT), under the supervision of Mihai Cucuringu and Xiaowen Dong. Prior to that, I received my MASc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of British Columbia in 2022, and BSc in Physics from Nankai University in 2019.

## **Research**
My research interest lies in the intersection of statistics and computation. Currently, I am focusing on better understanding computational tasks on graphs using tools such as statistics, spectral method, optimization, etc. My research involves proposing data-driven algorithms together with mathematical proofs, and at the same time, I seek to understand the nature of the problems/algorithms through the lens of those proofs. I am excited to see the transformation of ideas across different research fields.
