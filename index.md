## **About Me**
I am a research based master student in the department of ECE at the University of British Columbia. I am fortunate to work with Lele Wang and Weina Wang on my thesis project. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Physics from school of Poling at Nankai University in 2019.\

## **Research**
My current research interest is mainly about graph theory, probability theory  and random algorithms. More specifically, I'm  studying graph alignment problems. For such problem, I mainly focuses on investigating the information-theoretical and designing  efficient algorithms, which will succeed with high probability for graphs generated from some particular random graph models.

Beyond what I am working on, I am interested in spectral method, statistical learning theory. I also know fundamental physics and basic of machine learning.
